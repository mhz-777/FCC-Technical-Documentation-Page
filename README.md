FCC-Technical-Doc

The goal: https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

The demo: Full disclaimer I basically just wanted to 1:1 style this with MDN Docs as a design reference so I did just that. Anyways heres link:

the challenges: The HTML and CSS were relatively straightforward. The Javascript on the other hand was a mission and a half I tell ya. I must have spent
north of 2.5 hours on it. Just fixing one issue, and right after that finding another and having to fix that. heres a list of what came up in that timeframe:

* no way to close nav
* when clicking link, nav would not close
* body was still scrollable when inside nav menu
* nav menu open button only worked once
* nav menu styles went missing after opening and closing once
* body scroll was locked after clicking nav link or closing

the TL:DR: this project was boring. javascript is still confusing, but im getting more familiar.
